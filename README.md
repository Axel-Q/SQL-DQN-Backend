# MeowMeowLand

## Description
This is a simple game for demonstration purpose that I created for CS7675. The game is called MeowMeowLand and it is an interactive game where you explore the fantasy world and practice your SQL skills as a local character. You have to collect information and make choices to get through the game. The game is written in Python and uses reinforcement learning algorithm to personalize game experience and provide adaptive consequent storylines.
